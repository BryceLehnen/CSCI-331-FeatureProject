## Goal of the Project

There has been a clear lack of expression when it comes to browser homepages. Chrome has a boring frontpage that just takes you to Google and provides a few basic links to Youtube or Gmail. We set out to spruce it up, and expand on the idea of the link components. The clear issues were that homepages on browsers tend to be boring without a lot of function, so we solved just that. The background will showcase one of Daka's Firewatch backgrounds which change based on the time. Along with this is a settings menu that controls the link components that can be customized to give you quick access to the links you use the most.

## Technical Summary

NextJs was the framework used for this project. It allowed to create components for the links that made coding the project much easier. The only API used was sunrise-sunset API. It allowed us to use the users geolocation to send a fetch request for various timestamps. These timestamps told us when sunrise, solar noon, and sunset were. Along with those basic times were the three stages twighlight both before sunrise and after sunset. These times determined when the background would change to the cooresponding image that would idealy match what it looked like outside the users window on a clear day.
